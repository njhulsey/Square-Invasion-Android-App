# Square-Invasion-Android-App
During my sophomore year of highschool, I took the winter sports season off to develop my own android app. The app is called square invasion and can be downloaded on the google play store. 

WHAT I LEARNED:
- Using my skills with Java to make an app
- Android development (Android studio)
- Use of particle effects to bring more character to my game
